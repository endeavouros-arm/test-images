Repository for testing new images for the installation of EndeavourOS on ARM devices <br />
These images contain an EndeavourOS image complete up to including the "Desktop-Base + Common packages". <br />
The only things missing is some personalization and configuration plus a Desktop Environment or Window Manager. <br />
These are provided by a Calamares installer.  

# Installation Instructions

There are two methods for installing EndeavourOS on either a RPi 4 or Odroid N2 ARM SOC.

# Method one

The first method is to boot from the EndeavourOS x86_64 Live ISO available here:

https://endeavouros.com/latest-release/

Connect a target storage device to the computer, either micro SD or USB SSD. <br />
Boot into the EndeavourOS live ISO. <br />
Then click the welcome button labeled "EndeavourOS ARM Image Installer". <br />
Answering a few questions, will start a script that installs the image for you. <br />
Remove the uSD card or USB SSD and connect it to your RPi 4 or Odroid N2.

# Method two

The live ISO is not necessary in this procedure. <br />
On an operational Arch Linux (or derivative) computer: <br />
Connect a micro SD card or USB SSD enclosure to the computer's USB port or SD slot. <br />
Launch your favorite Terminal and maximize the window or make it at least 120 x 30
```bash 
# (switch to root - enter root's password)
su      
cd /tmp
```
In your tmp directory, make sure a folder named images does not exist
```bash
git clone https://github.com/endeavouros-arm/images.git
cd images
```
check permissions, should show image-install-calamares.sh as executable.
```bash
./image-install-calamares.sh
```
Follow the instructions.

Post-Install Method 2
After installation,
```bash
cd ..
# (remove the images directory)
rm -rf images  
# (exit root)
exit           
```
Connect the uSD or USB SSD enclosure to a Raspberry Pi 4b/400 device or Odroid N2/N2+ device.
Then boot up the device.
Openbox should automatically start up and present the Calamares installer.
Follow the instructions to complete the EndeavourOS install.
